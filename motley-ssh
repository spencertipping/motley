# Motley SSH command definition
motley_defmodule ssh <<'EOF'
SSH command
Defines an SSH service endpoint, optionally creating a named entry in
~/.ssh/config.

  foo ssh -l myself             # always use user "myself" to connect to foo
  foo ssh f -l myself           # create a connection f with user "myself"
  foo ssh f                     # create a connection f for host foo

If you name an SSH connection, you can refer to it as if it were a machine:

  f docker ...                  # configure docker using ssh connection f

Naming SSH connections is done by creating entries in ~/.ssh/config. Any such
names will have corresponding bash aliases.
